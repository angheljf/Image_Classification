# Image Classification

This repository contains files related to image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Files

- `classification.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset, training the CNN model, and evaluating its performance.
- `gradio.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains a Gradio application that uses the trained model for image classification.
- `cifar10_cnn.keras`: This is the saved model file for the trained CNN.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/angheljf/Image_Classification.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib gradio jupyter
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook classification.ipynb
    jupyter notebook gradio.ipynb
    ```
